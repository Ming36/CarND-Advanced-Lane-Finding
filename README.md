# CarND-Advanced-Lane-Finding

The goal of this project is to identify the road lanes in a video stream of a forward facing camera mounted centeraly in a moving vehicle.

We'll be using image manipulation techniques to extract enough information from each fram, or image, from the video and identify the lane lines, the radius of curvature and the distance from the camera to the center line of the road.
